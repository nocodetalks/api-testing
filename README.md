## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This tool is for testing purposes only
- Always keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly
- Some API providers may have CORS restrictions that prevent browser-based testing
- For production applications, always implement proper server-side API key validation
- The tool provides format validation and basic connectivity testing, but comprehensive testing should be done in your actual application environment

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Development**: Quickly test API keys during development
- **Debugging**: Troubleshoot API key issues
- **Onboarding**: Help team members verify their API keys
- **Documentation**: Demonstrate API key setup to clients or users
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate API keys before deployment
